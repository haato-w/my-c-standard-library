# my-c-standard-library
I implemented C standard library for low-level coding practice.<br>
Some functions have not been implemented yet. And I added some functions that does not in original C standard library.<br>
You can get clib.a archive file that has all functions I made with `make` command.<br>
Each header files are in each directories.<br>
